        <h2>What are red flags?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Red flags are warning signs of unhealthy, manipulative, or abusive behaviors in relationships. They’re often subtle at first, but noticing them early can help keep you safe.</strong>

    <section id="classic-red-flags"> 
        <h2>Classic Red Flags</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li><strong>Jealousy disguised as concern:</strong> “I just love you so much, I can’t stand to see you talk to anyone else.”</li>       
        <li><strong>Quick involvement / Love bombing:</strong> Intense affection or gifts early on, pressuring commitment.</li>
        <li><strong>Isolating you from friends/family:</strong> “You don’t need them, you have me.”</li>
        <li><strong>Controlling behavior:</strong> Dictating what you wear, who you see, or how you spend your money/time.</li>
        <li><strong>Constant criticism or put-downs:</strong> Belittling your looks, intelligence, or interests—“just joking” or not.</li>
        <li><strong>Blaming you for their actions:</strong> “If you hadn’t made me mad, I wouldn’t have yelled.”</li>
        <li><strong>Explosive temper or mood swings:</strong> You feel like you’re walking on eggshells.</li>
        <li><strong>History of bad relationships:</strong> “My exes were all crazy.”</li>
        <li><strong>Disregard for your boundaries:</strong> Pressuring you for sex, commitment, or to “just let it go.”</li>
        <li><strong>Gaslighting:</strong> Denying things you know happened, making you doubt your own memory or sanity.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimizing or excusing hurtful behavior:</strong> “You’re too sensitive.”</li>
        <li><strong>Threatening self-harm if you leave:</strong> Weaponizing their own well-being to keep you stuck.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial control:</strong> Taking your money, restricting access to finances, or making you justify every purchase.</li>
      </ul>

        <li><strong>Testing your loyalty:</strong> Creating drama or jealousy traps to “see how you react.”</li>
        <li><strong>Refusing responsibility:</strong> “It’s just how I am, because of my past.”</li>

        <li><strong>Keeping secrets:</strong> Sudden phone privacy, vague about past or daily life.</li>
        <li><strong>Your gut says something is off:</strong> Even if you can’t explain why—trust it!</li>

  <h2>Green Flags: Signs of a Healthy Relationship</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Open, honest communication:</strong> You can talk about feelings, needs, and concerns without fear of ridicule or retaliation.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect for boundaries:</strong> Your “no” is accepted without guilt trips, pressure, or punishment.</li>
    <li><strong>Support for your independence:</strong> You’re encouraged to have your own friends, interests, and goals.</li>
    <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Both people can apologize, take responsibility, and work on their mistakes.</li>
    <li><strong>Trust:</strong> You don’t feel like you have to prove your loyalty, and jealousy isn’t a daily issue.</li>
    <li><strong>Equality:</strong> Decisions, responsibilities, and emotional labor are shared—not dumped on one person.</li>
    <li><strong>Kindness and empathy:</strong> You feel heard, cared for, and valued—even in disagreements.</li>
    <li><strong>Healthy conflict:</strong> Arguments don’t get cruel or violent, and solutions are found together.</li>
    <li><strong>Safety:</strong> You feel physically, emotionally, and mentally safe—never threatened or controlled.</li>
    <li><strong>Celebrating each other’s successes:</strong> Wins are celebrated, not minimized or resented.</li>
    <li><strong>Shared values and growth:</strong> You can grow together, learn together, and change is welcomed, not feared.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Green flags aren’t just “nice to have”—they’re the foundation of a healthy relationship. You deserve them all.</em></p>

  <h2>How to Build Green Flags in Your Relationship</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Practice open communication:</strong>
      <br>
      Get curious instead of defensive. Share your feelings honestly (“I feel…” not “You always…”), and listen without planning your rebuttal.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Respect boundaries—yours and theirs:</strong>
      <br>
      Ask what’s comfortable. If someone says “no,” thank them for telling you. If you need space, state it gently but firmly.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Encourage independence:</strong>
      <br>
      Support each other’s friendships, hobbies, and solo time. Cheer them on! Don’t make everything about “us.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Take accountability:</strong>
      <br>
      Own your mistakes. “I was wrong and I’m sorry.” No “but you…” or deflecting. This builds trust fast.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Foster trust:</strong>
      <br>
      Be consistent and reliable. Keep promises, avoid secret-keeping, and talk through jealousy instead of letting it fester.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Promote equality:</strong>
      <br>
      Share decision-making and household tasks. Don’t assume one person will “just do it.” Ask, don’t assign.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Lead with kindness and empathy:</strong>
      <br>
      Pause before reacting. Imagine their perspective. Little acts of care and understanding go a long way.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Learn healthy conflict skills:</strong>
      <br>
      Take breaks when emotions run high, use “I” statements, and look for win-win solutions. It’s you two vs. the problem—not you vs. each other.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Prioritize safety:</strong>
      <br>
      Agree that violence, threats, and manipulation are never okay. Create a safe space for honest conversations, even about hard stuff.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Celebrate and support growth:</strong>
      <br>
      Notice progress, big or small. Celebrate wins together and encourage each other’s goals—even if they’re different!
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Remember: No one is born knowing how to do all of this. Healthy habits are built with practice, patience, and self-compassion.</em></p>
  <p><strong>Try This:</strong> Pick one tip above and practice it this week. Notice how it feels—for you and your relationships. Progress, not perfection!</p>
